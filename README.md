3. Proximity were used all over website especialy in homepage were the #explore and #BUYNFT buttons are grouped together for easy access to the user. Also the contents
  are grouped together to get a neat view to the user.
    contrast that include color, size and spacing are done perfectly for the website. such as the colors used are yellow(#D1D606) and blue(#7DABD6) and are perfectly 
  synced with the background and also the texts are readable. The emptiness around each element is a type of visual spacing. padding and margins are used efficently to provide
  spacing between each element.
    Montserrat font from google font is used all over the webpage and sizing used are bold, regular and x-large. some of the text are styled in yellow(#D1D606) color to
  highlight the important features and headlines of the particular areas.
    Alignment of each products are visually connected to another element.
    repetitions for buttons are used in BUYNFT and in connect us pages.

   also contains alternative text which help persons with disabilities
